A Water Flow Meter is a device used to measure the volume and rate of water flow through a pipeline. It plays a crucial role in various applications, including industrial processes, residential water supply monitoring, and agricultural irrigation systems. This project focuses on developing a smart water flow meter that integrates IoT-based monitoring to provide real-time data on water usage, enabling efficient water management. The proposed system utilizes flow sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless communication modules to accurately measure and transmit flow data to a central monitoring system. By implementing this technology, users can reduce water wastage, optimize consumption, and detect leaks or anomalies in the system. The smart water flow meter is expected to enhance water conservation efforts while ensuring cost-effectiveness and reliability in water distribution networks.
