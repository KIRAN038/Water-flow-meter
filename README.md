Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, yet traditional farming methods face challenges such as inefficient water usage, unpredictable weather conditions, and labor shortages. To address these issues, Smart Agriculture integrates IoT (Internet of Things), AI (Artificial Intelligence), and automation to enhance productivity and resource efficiency.

This project proposes a Smart Agricultural System that utilizes sensor-based monitoring for soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. The system automates irrigation based on real-time data, reducing water wastage and optimizing crop growth. Additionally, AI-driven analytics provide insights on weather forecasting, pest detection, and yield prediction, helping farmers make informed decisions.

The proposed system employs Arduino/ESP32, wireless sensors, cloud-based data storage, and mobile applications for remote monitoring and control. By implementing this smart agricultural solution, farmers can increase productivity, minimize resource wastage, and improve sustainability, ensuring a tech-driven, eco-friendly future for farming.
